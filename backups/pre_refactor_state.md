## Current Grade: B
Migration complete, basic production hardening done.

## Working Features

## Database Schema
- thoughts: 7 fields (including is_completed)
- clusters: 7 fields

- thought_clusters: 4 fields (junction table)
- thought_categories: 3 fields (junction table)

## Known Issues
- Type safety: Still uses `as any` casts (outdated Supabase types)
- No automated tests
- No error boundaries
- No rate limiting
- Basic loading states only

## Current Dependencies
- React + TypeScript
- Supabase (auth, database, edge functions)
- Google Gemini API

- TanStack Query

## Goal: A Grade
Add comprehensive testing, improve type safety, enhance error handling, add rate limiting, optimize loading states.
